# react-redux-sass-websockets-express
React - Redux - Sass - WebSockets - Express | Template

### What is this

This is a template to create a full-stack, `real-time`, web application that uses `Node.js` as a back-end.

### Getting started

First, you need to install all dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Second, start working:
```
npm run dev
```

### What now

Now you start coding your app.

You have all what you need to start creating an app with `react, redux, sass & express`.

All you need to do is writing your code where it belongs.

`React & redux` go in:
```
/code/app/app.js
```
`Sass` goes in:
```
/code/css/app.scss
```
`Express` and all `Node.js` go in:
```
/code/server/server.js
```
And as for the last file, `/code/server/api.jsx`:

**This file is optional and can be removed. It's an API file, but still, you can remove it.**
### Building and running back-end
Once you're done developing:
```
npm run start
```
